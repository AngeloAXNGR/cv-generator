### Other Notes
This is a refactored version of my [previous CV Generator](https://github.com/AngeloAXNGR/cv-project). Unlike the first version of the project, this version makes use of TypeScript for the different React Components.Furthermore, the project was refactored in a way where I've made use of contexts as a way to solve issues regarding prop drilling. Lastly, I also took this is as an opportunity to learn styled-components which explains the minimal CSS in the entire codebase.
